# Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable:
#  a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100].
#  Write a Python code  that takes this list
#  a and makes a new list that has only the even
#  elements of this list in it



a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

evenList = list()

for number in a:
    if number % 2 == 0:
         evenList.append(number)

print(evenList)
